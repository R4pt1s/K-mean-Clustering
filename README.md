# K-mean-Clustering
 It is the simplest unsupervised learning algorithm that solves clustering problem

K-means algorithm partitions n observations into k clusters where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean serving as a prototype of the cluster

## Installation
Use the package manager pip to install numpy and matplotlib.
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

## Execution
Create a set with 900 points
```bash
gcc ex2.c
./a.out
```

Run k-mean clustering algorithm
```bash
gcc prog2.c
./a.out
```

## Results
Our set before run k-mean clustering algorithm
```bash
python3 team_first.py 
```

Our set after run k-mean clustering algorithm
```bash
python3 team_last.py 
```

Error value of our dataset
```bash
python3 error.py 
```
